# Proposal Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The OHA voting system uses a **two-tier proposal workflow** designed to simplify user submissions while maintaining structured, detailed proposals for voting.

---

## Workflow Stages

### 1. User Submission (Plain Text Request)

**What users do:**
- Submit a simple plain text description of what they want to propose
- No need to structure questions, options, or details
- Just describe the idea in natural language

**Example submissions:**
```
"I think we should hire a lawyer to help with land acquisition"

"We need to decide on membership fees for next year"

"Can we vote on which marketing strategy to use?"
```

**Technical implementation:**
- Stored in `/src/data/proposal-requests.json`
- Type: `ProposalRequest`
- Status: `pending`

---

### 2. Admin Review & Structuring

**What admins do:**
- Review pending proposal requests
- Flesh out the plain text into structured proposals with:
  - **Title** - Clear, concise proposal name
  - **Description** - Detailed context and background
  - **Questions** - One or multiple questions for voting
  - **Options** - Custom voting options per question

**Admin converts:**
```
Plain text: "I think we should hire a lawyer"

‚Üì

Structured Proposal:
‚îú‚îÄ Title: "Legal Counsel Selection"
‚îú‚îÄ Description: "Selection of legal counsel for group land buying..."
‚îî‚îÄ Questions:
    ‚îú‚îÄ Question 1: "Which law firm should OHA engage?"
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Option 1: Law firm of Mr Maposa
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Option 2: Takundwa Mbereko Attorneys
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Option 3: Other Firm
    ‚îî‚îÄ Question 2: "How should we conduct due diligence?"
        ‚îú‚îÄ Option 1: Member Voting
        ‚îú‚îÄ Option 2: Committee Decision
        ‚îî‚îÄ Option 3: Professional Review
```

**Technical implementation:**
- Create new `Proposal` with full structure
- Update `ProposalRequest` status to `approved`
- Link request to proposal via `proposalId`

---

### 3. Active Voting

**What users do:**
- View structured proposals with all questions
- Vote on each question
- Provide justification for their votes

**Technical implementation:**
- Proposal status: `active`
- Votes stored per question in `users.json`
- Lock-in date enforced

---

## Data Structure

### ProposalRequest (Plain Text Submission)

```typescript

        },
        {
          id: "mbereko",
          label: "Takundwa Mbereko Attorneys",
          description: "Recommended by member with experience"
        },
        {

      ]
    }

## Next Steps (Implementation)

   - POST: Submit plain text request
   - GET: Fetch all requests (admin only)

2. **Update Admin Panel** to show pending requests
   - List pending proposal requests
   - Button to "Create Proposal" from request
   - Form to structure the proposal with questions

3. **Simplify User Submission Form**
   - Remove complex fields
   - Just: Plain text area + Submit button
   - Success message: "Request submitted for review"

4. **Implement Ranking Question Type** in UI
   - Drag-and-drop interface
   - Show ranked order
   - Validate ranking submissions
