    "description": "We have identified a 50-acre privately owned farm in Mazowe, approximately 45 minutes from Harare. The property has clean title deeds, good road access, and potential for subdivision. The asking price is $2.5M USD, which works out to approximately $50,000 per acre. This would provide enough land for 25-30 residential plots of 1,000-2,000 sqm each, plus commercial and agricultural zones.",
